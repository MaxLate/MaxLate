# Hi, I'm Max Spaeth👋

I’m an Analytics Engineer & Data Analyst with a solid knowledge of Data Science in FinTech. 

## My Data Journey

My data journey started in 2020 while I was in my Master's program in Industrial Engineering and still didn’t know where I was headed. I enjoyed math and business, but no topic ever sparked any real passion in me. One evening, I watched the Netflix documentary about Cambridge Analytica and was completely blown away. I wanted to analyze data about people and find patterns. So, like every good data person, I of course skipped the basics of data and algorithms and dived straight into Data Science. After calculating survival predictions for Titanic passengers up and down with my first ML models, I still had no clue how to work with arrays or query data. During the pandemic, I used my time to immerse myself in all kinds of topics.

Finally, I had found an intrinsic motivation where "work" no longer felt like "work." And that motivation hasn’t changed since. Every line of code in my Git profile is something I taught myself, and I’m already excited for every new learning experience that comes my way.

## 🛠 Technical Skills:
- **Languages**: SQL, Python, Jinja (dbt)
- **Tools & Platforms**: dbt, Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, Snowflake, Redshift, Google Analytics / Tag Manager
- **Collaboration**: Git, Confluence, MS Office
- **Project Management**: Jira, Click-up

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Working On:

I’m currently building a complete ELT process/pipeline with dbt, Airflow, and PostgreSQL to extract, enhance, and analyze my Strava data using an LLM, with the goal of eliminating the need for my Strava subscription. And of course, I’m learning the concepts hands-on, embracing all the little mistakes along the way.
